// JAVASCRIPT CALLBACKS
***********************
a callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
a callback function can run after another function has finished.

// FUNCTION SEQUENCE
************************
Javascript functions are executed in the sequence they are called. Not in the sequence they
are defined.

Example:
```
function a(){
    console.log("hello")
}
function b(){
    console.log("world")
}
b()
a()

// output: -> world
           -> hello
```

// SEQUENCE CONTROL



// ASYNCHRONOUS

functions running in parallel with other functions are called `asynchronous`.

The AsyncFunction object provides methods for 'async functions'. in javascript every async function is
actually an AsyncFunction object.

// lodash _.debounce() Method
This method is used to create a debounced function that delays a given function until after the started
wait time in milliseconds has passed.

What is _.debounce()

The debounce method creates a debounced version of a function that will postpone its execution
until after the specified wait time has elapsed since the last time it was invoked.

KEY FEATURES OF DEBOUNCE:
1.delay execution
2.cancel and flush methods(debounce has a cancel method to cancel function calls, and a flush method to immediately execute
the delayed function).
3.
